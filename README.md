# Disease Outbreak Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict disease outbreaks using machine learning techniques. It leverages datasets related to diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinson's disease, applying classification algorithms to assess potential health risks.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis
- Implementation of machine learning models
- Performance evaluation using accuracy metrics
- Support Vector Machine (SVM) for diabetes classification
- Random Forest algorithm for heart disease and Parkinson's disease classification
- Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) for handling class imbalance
- Streamlit-based web application for user interaction

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit
- Pickle

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/HARICHANDANACS/Diseases_Outbreak.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn streamlit imbalanced-learn
   ```
3. Run the Streamlit application:
   ```sh
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Usage
- Load the pre-trained models for diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinson's disease.
- Input the required parameters through the Streamlit web interface.
- Click the prediction button to generate results.
